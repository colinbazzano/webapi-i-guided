# Notes

- install 'express' -> 'npm i express'
- add an `index.js` file to the root folder
- add server code inside `index.js`
- run the API using `npm run server`
- test making a GET request to localhost:4000 with Insomnia

[ client ] send a `request` to the [ server ] send a `response` to the [ client ]
